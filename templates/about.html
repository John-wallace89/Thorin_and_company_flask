<h2>About page</h2>
<p>
   The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
   recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
   Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
   Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
   Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
   action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
   leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

         Thorin Oakenshield
      </h3>
      <p>
         Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his
         youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770.
         While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the
         Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At
         some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he
         gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death

      <p>
         Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's
         company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

         Fíli and Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly Bombur,
         they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's
         companions, who were most often named only in "group" references to the entire company.

         Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Oin's uncle was Fundin, the
         father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of
         Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to
         reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come
         along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
         the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived the Battle
         of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dain Ironfoot II along with many other
         dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

         A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and
         advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

         He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by
         Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

         Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and
         the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a book
         he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his heir after
         his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.
